  <h1>Privacy Policy – V12 Screaming Sound</h1>

  <p><strong>App:</strong> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.v12.screaming">V12 Screaming Sound</a><br>
     <strong>Package name:</strong> com.v12.screaming<br>
     <strong>Developer:</strong> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=4728659111611968018">Loods 4.C.a.7.5</a></p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how V12 Screaming Sound handles user data. This page is the official privacy policy for the V12 Screaming Sound application and should be linked from the app store listing.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. No user data collection</h2>
    <p>The developer does not collect personal user data. No personal information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, device identifiers, or location is collected by the application.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. No sharing with third parties</h2>
    <p>The developer does not share user data with any third parties, companies, or organizations. Because the app does not collect any user data, there is no data shared with advertisers, analytics providers, or other services.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Data storage & retention</h2>
    <p>Since the application does not collect or store personal data, there is no user data retained by the app or the developer. If the app temporarily generates or caches files on the device for app functionality (for example, generated images or temporary caches), those files remain on the user's device and are not transmitted to any server.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>As the app does not collect or transmit personal data, no server-side security measures are required for user personal data. For any temporary local files the app may create (e.g., images), standard local storage protections of the user’s device apply.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Children</h2>
    <p>The app is not designed specifically for children. Because no personal data is collected, there are no special child-data handling procedures in place. Developers should ensure compliance with local laws if the app purposefully targets children.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or the app’s data practices, please contact the developer at: <a href="mailto:muhammad.dawud91@gmail.com">muhammad.dawud91@gmail.com</a></p>
